### 1. Introduction â€” Why a New Grammar Model?

In translating classical Japanese texts like *Ise Monogatari*, we face a serious problem:
**Conventional grammar models (especially generative grammar) fail to capture the speakerâ€™s breathing, emotional flow, and spontaneous structure.**

Traditional grammar is good at analyzing sentence structure, but it assumes a **pre-planned utterance**, not a lived, moment-to-moment narrative.

To address this, I propose the **Process Grammar Model (PGM)** â€” a new way of understanding how language is actually used in real time.

### 2. What Is the Process Grammar Model?

PGM treats language as a **temporal process**, and divides grammar into two distinct layers:

| Type                  | Features                                         | Examples / Functions                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Immediate Grammar** | Spontaneous, emotion- and reaction-driven speech | "Ah", "You know", "Well then", "Eh?"       |
| **Adjustive Grammar** | Later adjustments for explanation or structure   | Subject-predicate, reasons, clarifications |

In short, we do **not** design a complete sentence before speaking.
We **react first**, and **adjust later** â€” a flow-based, human-centric model.

### 3. Application to Translation of *Ise Monogatari*

In my work, Iâ€™ve applied PGM to create a **three-layer translation system**:

1. **Literal Translation**: Preserving original word order, honorifics, negation, etc.
2. **Phrase Gloss with PGM Labels**: Identifying immediate vs. adjustive grammar.
3. **Natural Translation**: Reproducing the psychological flow and rhythm of narration.

This approach enables us to **preserve the breath and feeling of the storyteller**, not just the surface meaning.

### 4. Broader Implications of PGM

PGM has implications far beyond translation. It can be used for:

* **Language education**, especially listening and conversation
* **Digital annotation**, using structured formats like JSON
* **Poetic analysis**, e.g. *waka* and *haiku*
* **Cognitive modeling**, aligned with System 1 and System 2 theories

In this sense, PGM **adds a new axis to language modeling**: not just what is said, but *how* it is formed moment by moment.
