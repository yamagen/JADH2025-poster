## 🟦 JADH2025 Poster Presentation: Key Talking Points (English)

### ■ Background and Purpose

* **Challenges in translating classical Japanese literature**: The difficulty of balancing literal and liberal translation, and of reproducing word order and psychological flow.
* **Limitations of existing grammar models**: Generative grammar does not adequately explain the speaker's immediate language use.
* **Proposal of the Process Grammar Model (PGM)**: A translation model that emphasizes the flow of narration and shifts in psychological states.

### ■ Target Text and Translation Methodology

* **Target Text**: The 63rd episode of *Ise Monogatari* (beginning with "Tsukumogami").
* **Three-layered translation approach**:

  1. **Strict Literal Translation**

     * Faithfully reflects word order, syntax, honorifics, and negation.
  2. **Phrase Gloss**

     * Syntactic and semantic annotation based on Leipzig Glossing Rules.
  3. **Natural Translation**

     * A more fluent English rendering that conveys the narrator's intent, emotion, and context.

### ■ Example Translation: "Tsukumogami"

* **Background**: The "tsukumogami" is not an elderly woman, but a woman who is younger than Narihira and has three children.
* **Typical example of Immediate Grammar**:

  * Tone of speaking to children, digressions in conversation, and the use of "dream" stories as a euphemistic form of expression.
  * Children's immediate responses and a structure that invites the listener to participate.
* **Contrast between literal and natural translation**:

  * "A fine gentleman is coming!" — reveals the narrator's joy and hope.
  * "Other people are just so cold..." — reflects her loneliness and longing.

### ■ Significance of the Process Grammar Model (PGM)

* **Immediate Grammar**

  * Directly reflects the speaker's psychological state and conversational flow.
  * Allows greater freedom in word order and insertion, yet follows implicit rules.
* **Adjustive Grammar**

  * Aims for grammatical consistency and clarity through sentence-final adjustments.
* **Characteristics of PGM**:

  * Corresponds to System 1 and System 2 in dual-process psychology.
  * Enables low-stress, human-compatible translation processes.

### ■ Applications and Future Prospects

* **Educational applications**: Useful for literature and language education.
* **Expansion to other classical texts**: e.g., *Tosa Nikki*, *Kokin Wakashu*.
* **Integration with Digital Humanities**:

  * Gloss records structured in JSON.
  * Reusability and transparency via GitHub.

## 🟨 Questions to Anticipate (English)

* Why propose Process Grammar instead of relying on generative grammar?
* How are "Immediate Grammar" and "Adjustive Grammar" distinguished?
* Are the narrative techniques seen in the translation intentional?
* What would other researchers need to adopt this model (e.g., gloss format)?
* What are the future expansion plans?
