> **Title**: Translating *Ise Monogatari* through the Lens of the Process Grammar Model

### 🟨 1. Introduction – The Problem

Hi, thank you for stopping by.
This poster addresses a core challenge in translating classical Japanese literature, especially *Ise Monogatari*:
how do we preserve **the speaker's psychological flow**—the breath, hesitation, surprise—in translation?

Conventional grammar models like **generative grammar** are useful for structure, but they often **fail to explain real-time linguistic behavior**, especially in emotional or poetic narratives.

### 🟦 2. Our Proposal – Process Grammar Model (PGM)

So, I propose a new approach: the **Process Grammar Model**, or **PGM**.

PGM separates language use into two types:

* **Immediate grammar**: spontaneous, breath-based expressions (like exclamations, particles, responses).
* **Adjustive grammar**: more deliberate, structured adjustments made afterward.

This model reflects how speakers *actually* process and construct language over time—and how listeners *interpret* those cues.

### 🟧 3. Case Study – Episode 63 “Tsukumogami”

We apply this model to episode 63 of *Ise Monogatari*, the “**Tsukumogami**” scene.

An old woman with long white hair is mocked by young men, but one man responds with a poem that elevates her as someone who has lived beautifully for ninety-nine years.
We translated the episode in **three layers**:

1. Literal translation (with glosses),
2. Process-based explanation (PGM),
3. Natural, reader-friendly English.

This layering helps preserve not just meaning, but also **emotion and timing**.

### 🟩 4. Why This Matters

PGM offers a **more human-centered framework** for translation and literary analysis—especially valuable for teaching, digital annotation, and cultural interpretation.
We're also developing this as a JSON-structured data model to support **computational analysis** of classical Japanese.
