## 1. Introduction

* *Ise Monogatari* is a classical work of Japanese literature from the early 10th century Heian period.
* This study proposes a new interpretive framework called the **Process Grammar Model (PGM)** to modernize our reading of the text.
* Furthermore, the *Ise Monogatari* is reconstructed as a **bilingual Japanese-English edition**.

## 2. What is the Process Grammar Model (PGM)?

* Unlike traditional generative grammar, PGM views linguistic expression as a **sequential and incremental process**.
* Emphasizes the speaker‚Äôs or writer‚Äôs psychology, dialogic context, and immediacy of narration.
* Each sentence or phrase is analyzed from two perspectives: **Immediate Grammar** and **Adjustive Grammar**.

## 3. Annotation Structure

* Each episode is annotated on multiple layers:

  * **Literal Translation**: Strict adherence to syntax and word order.
  * **Gloss**: Following Leipzig Glossing Rules, functions are provided for each phrase and word.
  * **Natural Translation**: A more fluid rendering that reflects narrative flow and emotional tone.
* All annotations are recorded in **JSON format**, making them ready for computational processing and reuse.

## 4. Sample Analysis (Episode 63: The Woman with Graying Hair)

* A woman with three children (not elderly, but roughly younger than Narihira) tells them about a dream she had.
* Two children give indifferent responses, but the third (likely the youngest son) replies gently, and she is pleased.
* Later, a young man passionately declares his love and spends the night with her.
* When the woman visits the man‚Äôs house the next day, he sees her and questions whether he truly loves her.
* Ultimately, **the theme of compassion emerges more strongly than romantic fulfillment**.

## 5. Affinity Between *Ise Monogatari* and Process Grammar

* The narrative of *Ise Monogatari* features **numerous grammatical ambiguities and leaps**.
* Traditional grammar struggles to account for these, but **Process Grammar explains them naturally by tracing the flow of discourse**.
* Emotional transitions, shifts in viewpoint, and timing of utterances can be described in terms of immediate language processing.

## 6. Open Data for Public Use

* All 125 episodes are translated and annotated, and released as **open bilingual datasets on Zenodo**:

  * [PGM Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15613134)
  * [Literal + Natural Translation Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13994483)
* A promising case of **Humanities √ó Digital integration**, with potential applications across disciplines.
